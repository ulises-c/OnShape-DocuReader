# âœ… DONE

1. Refactor `public/app.js`
   1. Remove/archive the old monolithic `public/app.js` in favor of the modular entry `public/js/app.js` (index.html already loads it via `<script type="module" src="js/app.js"></script>`)

   2. Fix method name mismatches between DocumentService and ApiClient
      1. Update `DocumentService.getElements(documentId, workspaceId)` to call `api.getElements(documentId, workspaceId)` instead of `api.getDocumentElements(...)`

   3. Add missing method to ApiClient
      1. Implement `getComprehensiveDocument(documentId, params)` to request `/api/documents/:documentId/comprehensive` with query params and return JSON

   4. Add `getPartMassProperties` to DocumentService
      1. Implement `getPartMassProperties(documentId, workspaceId, elementId, partId)` delegating to `ApiClient.getPartMassProperties(...)`

   5. Fix invalid API access in DocumentController
      1. Replace direct `this.documentService.api.request(...)` usage with `this.documentService.getPartMassProperties(...)` to keep API access within the services layer

   6. Add missing `replaceState` to AppState
      1. Implement `replaceState(newState)` that freezes and emits the new state; used by `AppController`

1. Update the list view (default view)
   1. Add selection boxes
   2. Add a "get selected" button to complement the "get all" button
2. Update detailed view
   1. Add a "copy raw json" button
   2. Remove the `Creator` field, will be merged with `Created`
   3. Adjust the following fields:
      1. `Created` (currently unknown, but list view shows creator) and add in `creator`, example:
         1. 2024-Sep-16, 3:59:08 PM [John Smith]
      2. `Modified` should also have a similar output
         1. 2025-Jun-02, 3:59:08 PM [John Smith]
   4. Add the following fields:
      1. `notes`, `tags`, `documentLabels`
   5. Add a copy raw json to child documents within detailed view (e.g. the clickable tiles for types like: partstudio, blob, assembly, billofmaterials)
   6. Update the `copy raw json` button for child documents to copy everything from that child document including metadata.
3. Update project documentation
   1. Create comprehensive ONSHAPE_API.md reference document
   2. Update README.md with new features and current project state
   3. Update ARCHITECTURE.md with detailed architecture overview
   4. Refresh basic-usage.md with latest features and examples
4. Update what `get all`, `get selected` `get document` does
   2. Change default selections to all selected
   5. Fix `get selected`
      1. Ensure exporting only processes selected documents (frontend passes ids; backend scopes by ids)
