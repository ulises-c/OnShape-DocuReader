# Archive Index

This file provides a quick reference to all archived files in the `notes/archives/` directory.

## Archive Naming Convention

- **HISTORY-XXX.md**: Archived history entries (XXX = 001, 002, etc.)
- **TODO-XXX.md**: Archived completed TODO items (XXX = 001, 002, etc.)
- **DONE-XXX.md**: Archived completed DONE items from DONE.md (XXX = 001, 002, etc.)

## Current Archives

### History Archives

_No history archives yet - files created when HISTORY.md exceeds 500 lines/50KB_

### TODO & DONE Archives

**EXAMPLE**

| File    | Lines | Size | Date Range               | First Entry        | Last Entry           |
| ------- | ----- | ---- | ------------------------ | ------------------ | -------------------- |
| TODO.md | ~50   | ~3KB | 2025-09-24 to 2025-09-25 | Update detail view | Update README.d      |
| DONE.md | ~50   | ~3KB | 2025-09-24 to 2025-09-25 | Update list view   | Update documentation |


## Archive Guidelines

- Archives are created when files exceed size limits (500 lines/50KB for most files, 300 lines for TODO DONE section)
- Files are numbered sequentially (001, 002, etc.)
- Each archive contains a header with metadata about its contents
- Archives are read-only after creation
