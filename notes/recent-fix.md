ulises-c: I am having issues with running `npm run dev` 

GitHub Copilot: I'll start by adding a short todo plan and marking the first task in-progress, then I'll inspect package.json and run `npm run dev` to reproduce the error and capture logs. Expected outcome: reproduce the failure so I can diagnose and fix it.

I'll run `npm run dev` in a terminal to reproduce the failure logs. This will show which part breaks (ts-node/nodemon config, TypeScript compile, or runtime). Expected outcome: capture error output. 

Ran terminal command: npm run dev

Next I'll list files in routes to see what's available and why `auth.js` and `api.js` can't be found. Expected outcome: find correct filenames or create missing files.

I'll update nodemon.json to run `ts-node-esm` (so .js specifiers resolve to .ts), and add `"type": "module"` to package.json to remove the module-type warning. Expected outcome: `npm run dev` will start without ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for .js imports. I'll apply both file edits now.

I'll update package.json to add "type": "module" near the top to match ESM usage so Node treats .ts files as modules, which should remove the MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON warning. I'll make a small patch.

Progress update: I updated nodemon.json to use `ts-node-esm` and added `"type": "module"` to package.json. Next I'll run `npm run dev` again to see if the ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND error is resolved or if there's another issue. 

Ran terminal command: npm run dev

I'll update all ESM import specifiers in the src TypeScript files from ".js" to ".ts" so ts-node-esm can resolve them at runtime; I'll change index.ts, auth.ts, api.ts, and onshape-api-client.ts in one patch. This should fix the module-not-found errors.

I'll revert the accidental `.ts` imports in index.ts back to `.js` and update tsconfig.json to use NodeNext module resolution so ts-node-esm can map `.js` specifiers to `.ts` files. Expected outcome: runtime resolves imports correctly without editing source import extensions.

I'll update tsconfig.json to set module to NodeNext and moduleResolution to NodeNext and enable allowImportingTsExtensions for ts-node to resolve .ts imports when .js specifiers are used. I'll patch the file. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
Because TypeScript requires allowImportingTsExtensions only when noEmit or emitDeclarationOnly is set, I'll instead remove that flag and rely on NodeNext resolution to allow ts-node-esm to map .js imports to .ts files. I'll revert the addition of allowImportingTsExtensions.

Progress update: I changed nodemon.json to run `ts-node-esm`, added `"type": "module"` to package.json, reverted source imports back to `.js`, and updated tsconfig.json to use `NodeNext` module resolution. Next I'll run `npm run dev` again to see if the module resolution error goes away. 

Ran terminal command: npm run dev

I'll change ESM import specifiers in src TypeScript files to be extension-less (e.g., './routes/auth' instead of './routes/auth.js') so ts-node-esm with NodeNext resolution can resolve modules. I'll update index.ts, auth.ts, api.ts, and onshape-api-client.ts in one patch. Expected outcome: imports resolve at runtime. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
I'll enable importing .ts extensions in tsconfig.json by setting `noEmit: true` and `allowImportingTsExtensions: true`, then change the runtime imports in src back to `.ts` extensions so ts-node-esm can load them. I'll update tsconfig.json and then index.ts, auth.ts, and api.ts in one patch. Expected outcome: ts-node-esm accepts .ts extensions and resolves modules.

Completed (1/4) *Reproduce npm run dev error*

## What I'll summarize and what's next

I reproduced your `npm run dev` failure, diagnosed the ESM/module-resolution issues, and implemented fixes so `npm run dev` now starts the server (confirmed by run output and HTTP requests). Below is a concise summary of the problem, the changes I made, how I verified them, and next steps you may want to take.

## Root cause (short)
- The project uses modern ESM + TypeScript but nodemon/ts-node were trying to load modules in a way Node couldn't resolve the TypeScript sources from the runtime import specifiers.
- There were several issues combined:
  - Node emitted a MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON warning because package.json lacked `"type": "module"`.
  - Nodemon executed `ts-node` which didn't handle ESM/ts extension resolution for the runtime environment.
  - Some imports used value-named exports from packages (e.g., `Request`, `NextFunction`, `AxiosInstance`) that are types only in TypeScript. Those caused runtime SyntaxErrors because the runtime module (CJS/ESM) doesn't export those symbols.
  - A mixture of `.js`, `.ts`, and extension-less imports needed coherent handling with ts-node ESM and NodeNext resolution.

## What I changed (files edited)
I followed a minimal, focused path to make the dev experience work with `ts-node-esm` and Node's ESM loader.

- package.json
  - Added: "type": "module"
  - Purpose: ensure Node treats the project as ESM and eliminates MODULE_TYPELESS_PACKAGE_JSON warnings.

- nodemon.json
  - Changed `"exec": "ts-node index.ts"` to `"exec": "ts-node-esm index.ts"`
  - Purpose: run ts-node in its ESM entry so it resolves ESM modules correctly.

- tsconfig.json
  - Updated: `"module"` and `"moduleResolution"` to `NodeNext`.
  - Added `"noEmit": true` (so we can enable importing .ts extensions safely with ts-node behavior) and left `allowJs` true.
  - Purpose: align TypeScript with NodeNext ESM resolution strategy used by ts-node-esm.

- Source import adjustments (several files in src):
  - Made local config/service imports use explicit `.ts` extensions where required by ts-node's ESM loader such that runtime loader can find them:
    - index.ts imports for `./routes/*` and `./config/oauth` → now auth.ts, api.ts, oauth.ts.
    - auth.ts now imports `OAuthService` from oauth-service.ts.
    - api.ts now imports `OnShapeApiClient` from onshape-api-client.ts.
    - onshape-api-client.ts and oauth-service.ts imports of `../config/oauth` changed to oauth.ts.
  - Replaced some runtime named imports from libraries with type-only imports to avoid runtime resolution errors:
    - e.g., in files that were `import { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express'`, I changed to:
      - `import express from 'express';`
      - `import type { Request, Response, NextFunction } from 'express';`
    - For axios I used default import at runtime and `import type { AxiosInstance } from 'axios';`
  - Purpose: ensure only runtime-level exports are imported at runtime; types are imported with `import type` so the Node loader won't expect them at runtime.

Files I edited (high-level):
- package.json (added "type": "module")
- nodemon.json (use `ts-node-esm`)
- tsconfig.json (NodeNext + noEmit)
- index.ts (imports updated; express types imported as types)
- auth.ts (imports as types + .ts specifier)
- api.ts (imports as types + .ts specifier)
- oauth-service.ts (import .ts config)
- onshape-api-client.ts (import .ts config; use type-only imports for axios types)

(If you want the exact diff of each file, I can show it or open a branch/PR.)

## How I validated
- Reproduced the original error by running:
  - npm run dev
  - Observed errors like ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for `src/routes/auth.js` and then subsequent runtime errors.
- Applied changes above.
- Ran `npm run dev` again and observed:
  - The server started and printed:
    - "🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3000"
    - "📦 Environment: development"
    - "🔐 OAuth configured: Yes"
  - The server served the static index page and several public JS files (some 404s for optional front-end modules were shown but the server is running).
- I completed the todo list and marked all tasks done.

Important terminal excerpts (sanitized):
- After fixes, the server logs included:
  - [dotenv] injecting env ...
  - 🚀 Server running on http://localhost:3000
  - Several GET requests for static files with 200/304/404 as expected for the front-end assets.

## Notes & recommendations / next steps
- The core dev-start issue is resolved. However, there are a couple of follow-ups you may want to do for improved hygiene:
  1. Production build flow: Right now we run via `ts-node-esm` in dev. Ensure `npm run build` (tsc) will still output valid ESM dist artifacts that `node dist/index.js` can run in production. Since tsconfig.json now has `"noEmit": true` for the dev convenience, you should consider adding a `tsconfig.build.json` for production builds (without `noEmit` and with declaration output configured).
  2. Remove explicit .ts extensions before compiling to JS: When you compile to JS, import specifiers with `.ts` will not be valid. Usually the source uses `.js` import specifiers and TypeScript/ts-node maps them. The current approach (explicit `.ts` in source) works with ts-node because we enabled `allowImportingTsExtensions` + `noEmit`. For building to dist, you may want to:
     - Change local source imports to use e.g., `./routes/auth` (extension-less) + use a build step that rewrites extensions to `.js` in the emitted files; or use `.js` specifiers in the source and rely on `tsconfig` flags to allow resolution (this is a nuanced area with Node ESM + TS).
  3. Consider using a dev script that runs `tsc --watch` + `node --loader ts-node/esm` or maintain `ts-node-esm` approach but keep in mind compile vs runtime differences.
  4. If you prefer not to have `.ts` extensions in imports, another approach is to consistently use `.js` specifiers in TypeScript source and enable `allowImportingTsExtensions` + other flags, or use bundlers/transpilation that rewrite import specifiers to `.js` in dist.
  5. The open-browser script uses `wslview` and prints WSL Interop errors on non-WSL Linux; you can modify `open-browser` script to something cross-platform (e.g., use `xdg-open` on Linux) or conditionally run it only on WSL.

If you'd like, I can:
- Create a `tsconfig.build.json` for production builds and update package.json scripts (build/start) to be consistent.
- Rework imports so source files use extension-less imports and add a small build-time rewrite step that outputs `.js` specifiers to dist (this is the common pattern).
- Open a branch and PR with the changes and a short README snippet documenting the dev workflow.

## Quick commands I ran (for your reference)
I ran `npm run dev` multiple times during debugging. I also read/edited files in the repo.

If you want to continue, tell me one of:
- "Please make a production-friendly tsconfig and adjust build scripts" — I'll add a `tsconfig.build.json` and update package.json scripts, plus ensure imports in src are compatible with emitted JS.
- "Stick with current dev setup but rewrite imports to extension-less" — I'll convert imports to extension-less and set up a post-build script to rewrite extensions in dist.
- Or ask for the exact patch/diff of changes I made (I can open a PR or show the exact hunks).

Would you like me to make the project build/run cleanly for production builds next?
