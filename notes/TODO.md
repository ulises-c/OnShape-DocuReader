# TODO Section

1. Enhance BOM to CSV procedure
   1. Extract filtered BOM
      1. Currently: Extracts flattened BOM
      2. Goal: Extract flattened BOM, with columns filtered by headers, and rows filtered by contents in column (e.g. {"part name": ["PRT", "ASM"]})
   2. Replace calls to getCSV (deprecated) with bomToCSV
      1. Then delete getCSV
   3. Implement massCSVExporter
      1. Exports flattened CSV with default filtering options
   4. Implement user based filtering
      1. Instead of static filtering, allow checkboxes so that a user can define what the columns/rows should be filtered by
2. Indicators for downloads
   1. bomToCSV takes a while to download and nothing indicates if the download is working as intended or not
   2. May need to implement detailed API usage to track
3. Detailed API usage (keep track per session)
   1. Create infrastructure to later on keep track across sessions
4. Fix BUG - Clicking child elements in detailed view does not work as intended
   1. Supposed to open up something similar to detailed view, but a child element specific view. Currently does nothing
   2. May be out of scope for this project
5. Update detailed view
   1. The child documents (the other clickable tiles within a document), should also be updated to have a cleaner layout.
   2. Investigate why "Load Hierarchy Details" returns "No parent hierarchy available" even though there is a parent ID
   3. Go through documents and OnShape v12 API to understand document structure and other important things from the API
6. Update what `get all`, `get selected` `get document` does
   1. To maintain consistency files should automatically be downloaded to a set folder
      1. `~/OnShape-DocuReader/database/`
   2. Change how the download structure
      1. Understand the draw backs of the current structure
         1. Currently the options are a single JSON file, or a ZIP with organized folders
      2. I want a clean and organized folder structure, with the option to zip it, something like the following:
         1. 1 Large JSON file that is an overview of what was downloaded
            1. This overview file should have hashes for each file (and whatever nested structure there is for a document) or some way to check that what is currently downloaded is up to date
         2. Folders for each document downloaded
            1. Folder should have JSONs for each item downloaded, and their child element JSONs
            2. Thumbnails should also be downloaded within this folder (if selected)
   3. Implement image/thumbnail downloading
7. Fix TODO in `public/js/controllers/document-controller.js`
8. Update login workflow
   1. Current:
      1. If {authenticated: false}: stays in list view with "Loading...", user has to select "logout" then login
      2. If {authenticated: true}: list view loads, no issue
   2. Goal:
      1. Default to login screen, check authentication status, if authenticated proceed to list view
