# What is this file?

Contains timestamped & commit hash section work history if possible. Time stamp is in PST, 24-hour to keep things uniform

## Instructions for Agents & LLM

1. Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Update `notes/HISTORY.md` and `notes/TODO.md` after making changes
3. When updating the Work History, the flow should be reverse chronological (e.g. newest updates at the top)
   1. When completing TODO items, remember to move them to DONE.md
4. **CRITICAL: There should only be ONE `[not committed]` section at any time**
   - Always append new work to the existing `[not committed]` section if one exists
   - Never create a new `[not committed]` section when one already exists
   - Only create a new `[not committed]` section after the previous one has been committed (gets a commit hash)
5. Update the `[not committed]` section as work is done:
   1. Append to the existing `[not committed]` section if commits have not been made, but changes have been made
   2. If minor changes are made then append to the commit, do not create a whole new commit
   3. There is no need to mention that the `TODO` file was updated since the changes are reflected here
6. Update the tentative section name & update the section summary to reflect all uncommitted work
7. Take a look at both the `Example` and `Work History` and make sure to match the formatting
8. After completing a TODO item and updating the HISTORY, ask for confirmation to do the following:
   1. Create a commit, and update the hash in the `[not committed]` field
   2. DO NOT PUSH
