# What is this file?

Contains timestamped & commit hash section work history if possible. Time stamp is in PST, 24-hour to keep things uniform

## Instructions for Agents & LLM

1. Read `INSTRUCTIONS.md`
2. Update `notes/HISTORY.md` and `notes/TODO.md` after making changes
3. **CRITICAL: There should only be ONE `[not committed]` section at any time**
   - Always append new work to the existing `[not committed]` section if one exists
   - Never create a new `[not committed]` section when one already exists
   - Only create a new `[not committed]` section after the previous one has been committed (gets a commit hash)
4. Update the `[not committed]` section as work is done:
   1. Append to the existing `[not committed]` section if commits have not been made, but changes have been made
   2. If minor changes are made then append to the commit, do not create a whole new commit
   3. There is no need to mention that the `TODO` file was updated since the changes are reflected here
5. Update the tentative section name & update the section summary to reflect all uncommitted work
6. Take a look at both the `Example` and `Work History` and make sure to match the formatting
7. After completing a TODO item and updating the HISTORY, ask for confirmation to do the following:
   1. Create a commit, and update the hash in the `[not committed]` field
   2. DO NOT PUSH
